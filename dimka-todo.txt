1. Approach-A change the train dataset to be balanced;
    a. Try with balancing the train set (fix the 1:3) inherent ratio of the data.
    * Try with punishment of underrepresented class.

2. Approach-B Return the KMeans and try Spectral Clustering

3. Approach-C Write a grid-search based on CV on a balanced train set for GCN and GraphSAGE individually.
    a. Compare GCN Best Results with GraphSAGE best results
    b. Compare Worst Results of GCN and GraphSAGE
    c. Compare interesting results between GCN and GraphSAGE

- Wherever the train set is balanced, give details on it's composition and structure. Also explain what
test set you will use.
